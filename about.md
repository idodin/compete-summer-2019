# About Compete McGill

Competitive Programming at McGill - a.k.a **Compete McGill** was founded in 2018 with the purpose of spreading the joy of Competitive Programming at McGill University.

While our name does contain *"Competitive"*, we are **not a hardcore environment** - amongst our members (even Executives!), you'll find wildly varying skill-levels. At the end of the day,
we are here **for all students, regardless of their skill-levels, areas of study or previous experience**!

## What we do:

"Competitive Programming", in the traditional sense, refers to the **ACM-ICPC** style of competitions. ACM - ICPC is an International,
Inter-Collegiate Programming Competition, that focuses on challenging participants *algorithmic* skills, requiring contestants to produce
and code-up efficient solutions to proposed problems. Our **Summer Training focuses on ACM-ICPC style competitions** and we host lots of 
events throughout the year to train and send teams to **ACM-ICPC**.

In addition to the traditional, ACM - style competitions, we train and send teams to **CS-Games**, a Quebec-held event that is best described
as an **"Olympics of technical challenges."** - at CS-Games, Contestants take part in a myriad of events challenging their technical aptitudes such as:
"Functional Programming", "Software Engineering", "Security CTF", "Mobile Development", "Hardware Hacking" and lots more! 

## Our Achievements:

In **only our first year of running** our members have brought home lots of Awards! You can find some of them below:

 - ACM-ICPC Preliminaries (Hamilton College) - 1st Place Team
 - CS-Games X-treme Theory Competition - 1st Place Team
 - Google Games - 1st Place Team
 - CS-Games: Sports Competition - 3rd Place Team
 - CS-Games: Artificial Intelligence Competition - 4th Place Team
 - Google CodeJam - Round 2 Qualifications (Only 1500 out of 35000 Contestants qualify for Round 2)
 
## Getting Involved:

The best way to get involved with the club is to take part in our Summer Training. Try to communicate as much as possible by taking part in the weekly discord discussion
sessions and by posting on Facebook. 

**In the Fall Semester**, we will hold a **competition to select our 2nd ACM-ICPC team of 3 members**. Top ranking contestants in the Competition will
be selected as representatives of McGill University at ACM-ICPC. 

**In the Fall and Winter Semesters**, we will **collaborate with other clubs to select two teams of 10 members each** to take part in **CS-Games 2020.** Keep an eye out for announcements on this!

More than fostering an environment for Competitive Programming, we are here to **foster one where members are pushed to "break their limits"** - a crucial part in this is to 
build an environment where you are having fun and not continuously stressing out! **Please make sure to also come to our Social Events where we do fun stuff like Lazer Tag, Movie Nights and Board Game Nights!**
