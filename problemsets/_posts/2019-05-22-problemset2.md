# Week 2 Problem Sets

> This week, I listed CodeForces problems in order of increasing rank (as dictated by CodeForces). This might not be 
a good indication of difficulty, however... We also tried to **reduce the number of questions** so everyone will have attempted
more of the same questions when we discuss. <br/> -Imad

> I also suggest starting with Knapsack, from the Kattis section - its pretty [vanilla](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vanilla).
